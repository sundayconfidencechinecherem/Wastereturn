# WasteReturn 

**Every Waste Has Value. Sort Right, Earn More.**

WasteReturn is a comprehensive waste management platform that incentivizes proper waste disposal through a points-based reward system. Unlike traditional waste services that charge for pickup, WasteReturn pays citizens for their waste based on type, quality, and sorting accuracy.

##  Vision & Mission

### Vision
To create a cleaner, more sustainable Nigeria where every citizen is empowered to participate in waste management and earn from their environmental contribution.

### Mission
To transform waste from a "problem to dispose of" into a "resource to earn from" by building technology that makes recycling accessible, rewarding, and trackable for every household.

---

##  Problem Statement

### The Waste Crisis in Urban Nigeria

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Improper Disposal** | 60% of waste ends up in drains, waterways, or illegal dumps |
| **Low Recycling Rates** | Only 12% of recyclable waste actually gets recycled |
| **Mixed Waste** | Contamination makes recycling difficult and expensive |
| **No Incentive** | Citizens pay for waste collection with no financial benefit |
| **Informal Sector** | Scavengers pick only high-value items, leaving the rest |
| **Environmental Damage** | Blocked drainage causes flooding; burning waste pollutes air |

### The Opportunity

Citizens want to do the right thing, but:
- They don't know **how** to sort properly
- There's no **reward** for sorting
- Pickup is **inconsistent**
- They can't track their **environmental impact**

---

##  Solution

WasteReturn addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Points-Based Rewards:** Earn points for every kilogram of waste recycled
- **Tiered Points System:** Higher value for better sorting (Gold/Silver/Bronze multipliers)
- **All Waste Types:** From high-value copper to low-value nylons, every waste has value
- **Convenient Pickup:** Schedule pickups or use self-service drop-off centers
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Track your driver, your points, and your environmental impact
- **Multiple Redemption Options:** Cash out, pay bills, shop at partner stores, or donate to charity

---
