# WasteReturn - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** WasteReturn  
**Tagline:** "Every Waste Has Value. Sort Right, Earn More."  
**Duration:** Q2 2025 - Q1 2026  
**Status:** Discovery Phase

WasteReturn is a comprehensive waste management platform that incentivizes proper waste disposal through a points-based reward system. Unlike traditional waste services that charge for pickup, WasteReturn pays citizens for their waste based on type, quality, and sorting accuracy. The platform handles all waste categories—from recyclables to organics to residuals—with a tiered points system that encourages proper segregation at source.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Waste Crisis in Urban Nigeria

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Improper Disposal** | 60% of waste ends up in drains, waterways, or illegal dumps |
| **Low Recycling Rates** | Only 12% of recyclable waste actually gets recycled |
| **Mixed Waste** | Contamination makes recycling difficult and expensive |
| **No Incentive** | Citizens pay for waste collection with no financial benefit |
| **Informal Sector** | Scavengers pick only high-value items, leaving the rest |
| **Environmental Damage** | Blocked drainage causes flooding; burning waste pollutes air |

### The Opportunity

Citizens want to do the right thing, but:
- They don't know **how** to sort properly
- There's no **reward** for sorting
- Pickup is **inconsistent**
- They can't track their **environmental impact**

WasteReturn transforms waste from a "problem to dispose of" into a "resource to earn from."
